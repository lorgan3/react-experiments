This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## React experiments

### Treeview
**TODO:**
* ~~Only update required nodes.~~
* ~~Isolating.~~
* ~~Lazy loading.~~
* Searching.
* Custom actions per node.
* Find better solution to passing a callback to handleExpand and handleActivate.
* Clean up the akward separation between the TreeNodes and the TreeConfig.
* Truncate long node names in the middle.
* Drag and drop to switch parent?
* Figure out how to write jsdoc for typescript :)
