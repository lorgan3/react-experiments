This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## React experiments

### Treeview
An attempt at creating an efficient treeview with many options to customize it.

**TODO:**
* ~~Only update required nodes.~~
* ~~Isolating.~~
* ~~Lazy loading.~~
* ~~Searching.~~
* ~~Custom actions per node.~~
* ~~Truncate long node names in the middle.~~
* Find better solution to passing a callback to handleExpand and handleActivate.
* Clean up the akward separation between the TreeNodes and the TreeConfig.

### DebouncedInput
A very basic input field with a debounce and shows a spinner until the callback resolves.

### Topology
Toy attempt to render svgs using react.

**TODO:**
* Fix the pick algoritm sometimes not working.
