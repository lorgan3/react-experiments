## React experiments

### Treeview
**TODO:**
* ~~Only update required nodes.~~
* ~~Isolating.~~
* ~~Lazy loading.~~
* ~~Searching.~~
* ~~Custom actions per node.~~
* ~~Truncate long node names in the middle.~~
* Find better solution to passing a callback to handleExpand and handleActivate.
* Clean up the akward separation between the TreeNodes and the TreeConfig.
